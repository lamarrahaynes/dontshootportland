# Directions for viewing this website while it is in progress

You will require [git](https://git-scm.com/) to grab the code in this repository and you will require [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to view the website locally.

To get the contents of this repository on your computer run these commands

```
git clone https://github.com/lamarrahaynes/dontshootportland
cd dontshootportland
```

This will copy the repository to your computer and then move you into the project's root directory.  You can now use node to view the website.  Node has a handy program called the node package manager (npm).  Run these commands to get started.

```
npm install
npm start
```

These commands will install all of the project dependencies in your local project directory and deploy the site on your local host.  To view the website, just navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
